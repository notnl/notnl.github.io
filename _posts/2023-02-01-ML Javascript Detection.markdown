I was assigned to design a platform to detect malicious javascript upon upon a click of a button

The whole idea behind this frankly speaking, is so that it could be refactored for other purposes involving textual content. 

Thus, it felt more like a template to be used, rather than a proper project. 

Regardless, I took this opportunity to learn about fullstack work , all the way up to deployment. Note that I could only publish this after receiving the
appropriate permissions.

## Tech Stack:

**Build Tool : Vite**

**Frontend: React**

**Web server: Nginx**

**Backend: Flask (Gunicorn as WSGI)**

**A.I Model: XGBoost**
